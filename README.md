# Hi there! üëã I'm Raghav Gupta

3rd year Computer Science student at NTU with a passion for Machine Learning, Full-Stack Development, and Open Source.

## What I'm up to

- Currently building **production-grade applications** ‚Äî from **C++ networked systems** to **full-stack platforms** and **AI-powered tools**.  
- Working on open-source projects to strengthen skills in **system design**, **distributed computing**, and **backend architecture**.  
- Ask me about C++, scalable backend systems, full-stack development, or how to integrate AI into production software.  
- Reach me at **raghav008@e.ntu.edu.sg** or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghav-gupta-0325081a0/)  
- Fun fact: As Vice-President of **NTU Open Source Society**, I‚Äôve helped connect hundreds of students with open-source opportunities and guided them in contributing to real-world projects.  

## About Me
