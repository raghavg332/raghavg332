## 🌟 Featured Projects

### RAG System for Aircraft Maintenance (Singapore Airlines)
Developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that assists engineers with maintenance procedures by retrieving and contextualizing technical documentation. Built using:
- PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers for LLM fine-tuning and inference
- FAISS vector database for efficient similarity search across technical documents
- Local deployment for secure, offline access to sensitive documentation

### Student Risk Assessment Tool
Developed an ML-powered tool achieving 88% accuracy in identifying at-risk students, featuring:
- Random Forest Classifier and Neural Networks
- Flask + React.js web application
- Redis-powered asynchronous processing
- Containerized deployment on AWS using Kubernetes
